Welcome to my website!<br />
I'm Yufei Zheng, a second-year master's student in Economics at Duke University. I'm applying for PhD in Economics in Fall 2025. I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2019, where I majored in Mathematics and Economics and minored in Information Technology.<br />
My research interests lie in applied microeconomics, especially in the fields of Labor Economics, Family Economics, Gender Economics and Education Economics.
