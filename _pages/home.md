Welcome to my website!<br />
I'm Yufei Zheng, a second-year master's student in Economics at Duke University. I'm applying for PhD in Economics in Fall 2025. I graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2019, where I majored in Mathematics and Economics and minored in Information Technology.<br />
My research interests lie in Applied Microeconomics, and more specifically, in the fields of Labor, Family, Gender and Education. <br />
